Firmware understands these G codes:

    G0      Rapid Move              X Y Z E F
    G1      Controlled Move         X Y Z E F
    G2      CW Arc      XYZ E F I J
    G3      CCW Arc     XYZ E F I J
    G4      Dwell       P:ms to wait    S:seconds to wait
    G28     Home Axis
    G90     Absolute Mode
    G91     Relative Mode
    G92     Synchronize

    M83     (exceedingly rare?)
    M84     (exceedingly rare?)
    M101
    M103
    M104    (very rare?)
    M108
    M109    (exceedingly rare?)
    M113

If there are multiple G- or M-codes in a single line, the first G-code found is
processed;  if the line does not contain a G-code, then the first M-code found
is processed.  Otherwise, an error is returned.  The first X/Y/Z/... parameter 
found for each code is used.

In practice, this means that there should only ever be a single G- or M-code
per line, and that duplicate parameters should not be present.

Sadly, about the best we can do is ... well, nothing.
