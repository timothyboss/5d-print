Firmware understands these G codes:

    G0      Rapid Move              X Y Z E F
    G1      Controlled Move         X Y Z E F
    G2      CW Arc      XYZ E F I J
    G3      CCW Arc     XYZ E F I J
    G4      Dwell       P:ms to wait    S:seconds to wait
    G28     Home Axis
    G90     Absolute Mode
    G91     Relative Mode
    G92     Synchronize

If there are multiple G- or M-codes in a single line, the first G-code found is
processed;  if the line does not contain a G-code, then the first M-code found
is processed.  Otherwise, an error is returned.  The first X/Y/Z/... parameter 
found for each code is used.

In practice, this means that there should only ever be a single G- or M-code
per line, and that duplicate parameters should not be present.

Sadly, about the best we can do is ... well, nothing.
